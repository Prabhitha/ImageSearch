## Image search engine using Deep Learning Model

Just like Google image search, here we are going to build a simple Image search engine using the Deep learning model VGG16. Given a query image, we are going to display images similar to it. We are going to implement it using Keras (It is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks)and Flask (It is a micro web framework written in Python).
